# rekoCards
A python class to read the Amiga card sets or the PC card sets

Card sets can be found here:

https://www.rproductions.nl/cardgames/

or here:

https://www.rekonet.org/ (a little bit outdated but still there)

Inormation for the REKO or RKP files can be found inside this archive:

https://www.rekonet.org/programs/Amiga/sdiREKO-DT.lha

For the newer card set PCRKP I did some reverse engineering, so possible to use them too. 


There are different file types:

REKO = Amiga card sets

RKP = PC card sets

For testing the card images are converted to TGA's images and saved in the output folder. (see TGA class)

The newer format contains's JPG's so there are saves as JPG's of course.
